## Introduction

AntdSite is a website generator based on [Ant Design](https://ant.design), driven by [Gatsby Js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). (You can totally ignore these two technologies, just know the basic knowledge of markdown, and then simply configure it to build a website. Of course, it would be better if you could do both. The configuration of documents refers to the vue-based document generator - [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/config/).

## Features

- It's easy to get started, you just need to know markdown and a little bit about JS.
- Powerful, you can write react components in markdown, referring to [mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).
- It can directly use many components of Ant Design (https://ant.design/components/button/) to meet daily development needs.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i antdsite -g

antdsite my-docs
```
