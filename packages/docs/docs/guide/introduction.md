# Introduction

AntdSite is a documentation generator based on [Ant Design](https://ant.design), driven by [Gatsby Js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)(You can totally ignore these two technologies, just know the basic knowledge of markdown, and then simply configure it to build a website. Of course, it would be better if you could do both). The configuration of documents refers to the vue-based document generator - [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/config/).

<div class="pic-plus">
  <img width="150" src="/antd-icon.svg" />
   <span>+</span>
  <img width="160" src="/react-icon.svg" /> 
    <span>+</span> 
  <img width="144" src="/gatsby-icon-144x144.png" />
</div>
